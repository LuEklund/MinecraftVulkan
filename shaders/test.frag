Below is an example of how you could implement ambient occlusion in a fragment shader for a cube-based world (like a Minecraft clone) using GLSL for Vulkan. This example assumes you have a 3D texture (or a buffer) containing world data where each voxel (block) is represented by a value (for example, 1.0 for a solid block and 0.0 for empty).

Note: This example is simplified. In a real-world scenario, you might need to adapt the mapping of world coordinates to texture coordinates and take into account the face orientation you are rendering. Here we assume, for example, that the face being rendered is the top face of a block.

#version 450

// 3D texture containing the block information.
// It is expected to store values in the red channel indicating the presence of a block.
layout(set = 0, binding = 0) uniform sampler3D uBlocks;

// Local UV coordinates for the face (range from 0 to 1)
layout(location = 0) in vec2 fragUV;

// Fragment's world position
layout(location = 1) in vec3 fragPos;

// Base color (for example, passed from the vertex shader or another uniform)
layout(location = 2) in vec3 baseColor;

// Final output color
layout(location = 0) out vec4 outColor;

// Function to get the block value at a given position.
// It uses nearest sampling to obtain discrete values.
float getBlock(vec3 pos) {
// Here we assume that world coordinates directly correspond to the texture coordinates.
// In practice, you might need to apply scaling or an offset.
return texture(uBlocks, pos).r;
}

// Calculates the ambient occlusion for one corner (vertex) of the face using neighboring blocks.
// basePos: the base position (e.g., the lower-left corner of the block)
// offset1 and offset2: offsets toward the adjacent neighbors
// offsetDiag: offset toward the diagonal neighbor
float aoCorner(vec3 basePos, vec3 offset1, vec3 offset2, vec3 offsetDiag) {
float side1 = getBlock(basePos + offset1);
float side2 = getBlock(basePos + offset2);
float corner = getBlock(basePos + offsetDiag);

// If both adjacent neighbors are solid, assume maximum occlusion.
if (side1 > 0.5 && side2 > 0.5)
return 0.0;

// Average the contribution from neighbors. Adjust the divisor or formula as needed.
return 1.0 - (side1 + side2 + corner) / 3.0;
}

void main() {
// For this example, we assume the face is the top face of the block.
// Get the integer position of the current block.
vec3 blockPos = floor(fragPos);

// Calculate the AO for each of the four corners of the top face.
// For the top face, the offsets are applied in the X and Z directions (keeping Y constant).
// Lower-left corner
float ao00 = aoCorner(blockPos, vec3(-1, 0, 0), vec3(0, 0, -1), vec3(-1, 0, -1));
// Lower-right corner
float ao10 = aoCorner(blockPos, vec3(1, 0, 0), vec3(0, 0, -1), vec3(1, 0, -1));
// Upper-left corner
float ao01 = aoCorner(blockPos, vec3(-1, 0, 0), vec3(0, 0, 1), vec3(-1, 0, 1));
// Upper-right corner
float ao11 = aoCorner(blockPos, vec3(1, 0, 0), vec3(0, 0, 1), vec3(1, 0, 1));

// Bilinear interpolation using the face's local UV coordinates (fragUV)
float ao = mix(mix(ao00, ao10, fragUV.x),
mix(ao01, ao11, fragUV.x),
fragUV.y);

// Apply the AO factor to the base color of the fragment
vec3 finalColor = baseColor * ao;

outColor = vec4(finalColor, 1.0);
}

Explanation

Uniforms and Inputs:
A sampler3D is declared to access block data.
Local UV coordinates (fragUV), the world position (fragPos), and the base color (baseColor) are passed to the shader.

getBlock Function:
This function samples the 3D texture to determine if there is a block at the specified position (values near 1.0 indicate a solid block, while values near 0.0 indicate empty space).

aoCorner Function:
Evaluates the adjacent neighbors and the diagonal neighbor to determine the occlusion factor at that corner.
If both adjacent neighbors are solid, it returns 0.0 (indicating maximum occlusion); otherwise, it averages the contribution from each neighbor.

Main Function:
The integer position of the block is calculated using floor(fragPos).
AO is computed for each of the four corners of the top face.
Bilinear interpolation (mix) is used with the UV coordinates to obtain the AO value for the current fragment.
Finally, the base color is multiplied by the AO value to produce the final color.

This code provides a starting point for implementing vertex-based ambient occlusion in a fragment shader for a cube world in Vulkan. Adjust offsets and formulas as necessary to fit the specific faces and requirements of your engine.
